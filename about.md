Hi!
I'm Marvin, an electronics enthusiast based in the beautiful franconian switzerland. I currently work at a local electronics company mainly doing hardware design for heating control systems. My main interests are electronics (duh!), FPV Racing, 3D Printing and Motorcycles. I'm not really much of a code guy yet but i plan on changing that by taking on some more involved projects. 

If you want to contact me, these are my socials:
